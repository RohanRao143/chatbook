Real-World Performance Results
Hereâ€™s what actually happened with my test document:

marker-pdf (11.3s): Perfect structure preservation, ideal for high-quality conversions, long time though

pymupdf4llm (0.12s): Excellent markdown output, great balance of speed and quality

unstructured (1.29s): Clean semantic chunks, perfect for RAG workflows

textract (0.21s): Fast with OCR capabilities, minor formatting variations

pypdfium2 (0.003s): Blazing speed, clean basic text, no structure

pypdf (0.024s): Reliable extraction, occasional spacing artifacts

pdfplumber (0.10s): Good for tables, text extraction needs configuration

Important caveat: These results reflect basic usage with minimal configuration. Each library has advanced features that could significantly change performance for specific use cases. You can find the link to all results in the references.
