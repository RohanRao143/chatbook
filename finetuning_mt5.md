# A fine-tuning setup would involve:
# 1. Loading the pre-trained mT5-small model.
# 2. Loading a task-specific dataset (e.g., from Hugging Face Datasets).
# 3. Preparing the dataset for the model (tokenizing and formatting).
# 4. Using the `Trainer` API from Hugging Face or a custom training loop to train the model on the new data.

# Example from Hugging Face for fine-tuning on a question-answering task:
# from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer, ...
# ... (load dataset and model) ...
# training_args = TrainingArguments(...)
# trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, ...)
# trainer.train()
